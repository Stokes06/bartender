BARTENDER
===

Bartender asks what you want to drink : beer, juice or nothing.

Depending on your choice :
- nothing : ends the program
- juice : "Bartender gives you a nice juice, refreshing !" ==> loops back to first question
- beer : triggers a new event

Beer event : The bartender asks for your age ==> enter your birthdate
- If you are 18 : "Bartender gives you a beer, drink in moderation !" ==> loops back to first question
- If you are not 18 : "You can't have a beer kiddo"  ==> loops back to first question
